Use the directional buttons on the screen to move the car
around the racetrack!

Some issues I have that I plan on fixing for future releases is 
the fact that the left and right movement of the car is a little twitchy,
it still works but I personally don't like how it looks.

This game should not be redistributed by anyone except for the creator.
