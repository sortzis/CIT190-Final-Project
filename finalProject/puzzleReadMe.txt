Fit the puzzle pieces in the border to create a picture!

An issue I would like to fix and add to future releases is to 
have the puzzle pieces appear closer together rather than in a line 
down the page. I don't like how you have to scroll to find the rest of the
pieces.

This game should not be redistributed by anyone except for the creator.
